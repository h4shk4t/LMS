LMS is a simple Library Management System.

## Requirements
You need to have a PHP interpreter, MySQL server and composer installed to run the web application.
The database connections and database queries have been handled with the help of PHP data objects.

## Dependencies
The webapp is built on the ToroPHP web framework and the templating engine used is twig version 3.0.

You can refer its documentation on the following links:
    1. ToroPHP - https://github.com/anandkunal/ToroPHP
    2. Twig - https://twig.symfony.com/doc/

## Installation
You can automatically setup the application by running the setup.sh script.

It will install the required dependencies and load the database schema.

## Usage
On changing directory to the public folder of the app, you may launch the development server with the following command
```php -S localhost:PORT```
Where the PORT is any port you want to run the local web server on.

Also to run the following web app on an Apache server, copy the VHOST file to the default VHOST directory (/etc/apache2/sites-available/ for Linux) and change the DocumentRoot and Directory as per your preference. You can additionally configure your own hosts file to locally route your domain to the localhost.
